# 628module1-bodyfat
Hi everyone!

In this project, we build a two-term nonlinear model to estimate percentage of males' body fat based on a real data set of 252 men. Our model has a good balance between simplicity, robustness, accuracy and precise. We also build a body fat calculator written by Rshiny.
